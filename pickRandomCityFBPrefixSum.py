"""
Given a list of city names and their corresponding populations, write a program to output a random city name subject to the following constraint: the probability of the program to output a city's name is based on its population divided by the sum of all cities' population. Assume the program will be repeatedly called many times.

For example:

NY: 7
SF: 5
LA: 8
The probability to generate NY is 7/20, SF is 1/4, LA - â…–

Prefix sum array
7	5	8
7	12	20
NY	SF	LA
